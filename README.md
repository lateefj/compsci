Computer Science Interview Algorithms

This is created so I could implement _from_ _scratch_ a handfull of computer science standard interview algoritms
and data structures. Hopefully to save time in interviews so can actually talk about intereasting stuff like large
search space and Genetic Algorithms or something related to my experience. Maybe even more day to day pros and cons
of X technology or Y technology. Plus it would be a lot more fun doing it here than in an interview setting which I find
very unrealistic. 
Implementation: I choose to implement these in Go to help increase my proficiency in the language. Mainly on a chromebook
instead of reading I figured I would write these to get me to sleep at night.
